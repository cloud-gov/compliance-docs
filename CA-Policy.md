## Procedures

As a cloud service provider that is also part of the General Services Agency (GSA), a federal agency, 18F ensures cloud.gov invests in comprehensive risk management assessments.

The main assessment procedures used are the [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/). Further, 18F engages an [accredited third-party assessment organization](https://www.a2la.org/appsweb/fedramp.cfm?standpk=131&title=FedRamp&certno=0.68&explain=yes&CFID=8562345&CFTOKEN=2092ae74d77c6326-5E473667-5056-A51D-2C61F063908820F4) (3PAO) to provide an independent review of the cloud.gov system and organizational operations.

Assessments of 18F operations are performed in tandem with vulnerability scanning, malicious user testing, insider threat assessments, and other tests regularly conducted by the following teams: the cloud.gov team, TTS Infrastructure, GSA Information Security, and a 3PAO. The system is also under continuous monitoring from cloud.gov's Cloud Operations team.

18F takes any results seriously, and it implements remediations as soon as possible. Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are maintained to ensure any findings are resolved, compensated for, or accepted as an operational requirement.

See CA-2, CA-2(1), CA-2(2), CA-2(3), CA-5, CA-7, CA-7(1), CA-8, CA-8(1).
