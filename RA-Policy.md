# 18F Risk Assessment Policy

## 1 Purpose of Policy
This Risk Assessment Policy seeks to provide governance over a formal, documented risk assessment structure that addresses purpose, scope, controls, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination and compliance.

The 18F program includes a library of policies that address federal and commercial requirements. These policies guide and govern the actions of 18F employees and contractors in conducting any United States (U.S.) business.

This policy is written to include the following:
* Security Categorization
* Risk Assessment
* Vulnerability Scanning

## 2 Scope of Policy
This policy applies to all 18F employees, contractors and vendors working in non-public areas and facilities where information systems reside. This includes cloud infrastructure components, leveraged services and other elements used to deliver 18F products and services.

## 3 Policy
The access and use of Information Technology (IT) resources shall be in compliance with applicable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications, International Organization for Standards (ISO) and 18F policies and standards.

### Security Categorization
18F:
* Must categorize information and the information system in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;
* Document the security categorization results (including supporting rationale) in the security plan for the information system; and
* Ensure the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the Authorizing Official (AO) or authorizing official designated representative.

### Risk Assessment
18F:
* Must conduct an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;
* Document risk assessment results in vulnerability scan reports, security assessment reports, plan of actions and milestones
* Reviews risk assessment results are conducted on a as needed basis
* Updates the risk assessment annually or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.

### Vulnerability Scanning
18F:
* Must conduct scans for vulnerabilities within information systems and hosted applications on a weekly basis and on-going for continuous monitoring and incident response processes when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported
* Must employ vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
  * Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
  * Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
  * Measuring vulnerability impact;
* Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
* Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities (Highs within 30 days, Moderates within 90 days, Lows within 120 days) in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk
* Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with designated personnel throughout the organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
