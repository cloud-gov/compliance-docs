## Purpose of Policy
This Risk Assessment Policy seeks to provide governance over a formal, documented risk assessment structure that addresses purpose, scope, controls, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination and compliance.

The 18F program includes a library of policies that address federal and commercial requirements. These policies guide and govern the actions of 18F employees and contractors in conducting any United States (U.S.) business.

This policy is written to include the following:
Security Categorization
Risk Assessment
Vulnerability Scanning

## Scope of Policy

Reviews risk assessment results are conducted on a as needed basis
Updates the risk assessment annually or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.

### Vulnerability Scanning
18F:
Must conduct scans for vulnerabilities within information systems and hosted applications on a weekly basis and on-going for continuous monitoring and incident response processes when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported
Must employ vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and
Measuring vulnerability impact;
Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities (Highs within 30 days, Moderates within 90 days, Lows within 120 days) in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk
