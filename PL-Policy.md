# 18F security Planning Policy

## 1. Purpose of Policy
The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources. The purpose of system security plans is to provide an overview of the security requirements of information systems and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured process of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system.

This Policy establishes the basis for implementing security planning practices for protecting information systems and data within 18F systems, products and networks.

The 18F program includes a library of policies that address federal and commercial requirements. These policies guide and govern the actions of 18F employees and contractors in conducting any United States (U.S.) business.

This policy is written to include the following:
* System Security Plan
* Rules of Behavior
* Information Security Architecture

## 2. Scope of Policy
This policy applies to all users, systems, networks, components, services and processes in or accessing the 18F Production environment, and all services, applications and products in General Availability.  This includes cloud infrastructure components, leveraged services and other elements used to deliver 18F products and services.

## 3. Policy
The access and use of Information Technology (IT) resources shall be in compliance with applicable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications, International Organization for Standards (ISO) and 18F policies and standards.

### System Security Plans
* 18F will create, modify and implement System Security Plans (SSP) that:
 * Remain consistent with 18F enterprise architecture;
 * Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for information systems;
 * Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of mission and business process;
 * Provides the security categorization of the information system including supporting rationale;
 * Describes the operational environment for the information systems;
 * Describes relationships with or connections to other information systems;
 * Provides an overview of the security requirements for the systems;
 * Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements; including a rationale for the tailoring and supplementation decision;
 * Reviewed and approved by authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation
* Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes to the plan to information system owners, information system security officers/managers and, authorizing officials and others on a need to know basis
* 18F must review the system security plans for information systems annually and update system security plans to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments.
* Protects security plans from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

### Rules of Behavior
* 18F will establish and make readily available to all users the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regards to information and information system usage
* 18F documents acknowledgment from users indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and information systems.
* 18F reviews and updates the rules of behavior on an annual basis and requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and re-sign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.

### Information Security Architecture
18F develops information security architecture for its information systems that:
* Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information
* Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the enterprise architecture and any information security assumptions about and dependencies on external services
* Reviews and updates the information security architecture on a periodic basis to reflect updates in the enterprise architecture
* Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in system security plans and organizational procurements/acquisitions.
