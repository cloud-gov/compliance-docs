## Procedures

If cloud.gov staff fail to comply with GSA IT security training requirements, their access to GSA information systems is terminated. This includes access to cloud.gov systems.

See AT-2, AT-2 (2).

The cloud.gov Program Manager ensures that Cloud Operations staff with significant information system security roles complete role-based security-related training at or upon being granted access, and subsequent refresher training at least annually.

Whenever a new person joins the Cloud Operations team, the cloud.gov Program Manager assigns the team member a GitHub issue documenting a checklist of required training materials. The same process is applied to each team member annually as if they were a new team member.See AT-3, AT-4.
