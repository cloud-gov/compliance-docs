## Purpose

Create information systems with the most sophisticated, strongest, and reasonable cryptographic methodologies available. Structure networks with the lowest amount of access and trust possible, achieving "zero trust" network systems and designs wherever possible. Ensure communication channels fail into "closed states" if the confidentiality or integrity of the communication channel is disrupted.

## Scope
